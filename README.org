* cl-num-utils

This library will replace cl-numlib.  It is still experimental, and
the interface changes constantly.  Nevertheless, parts that are
available are usually tested and usable.  Comments are welcome.

** Tasks
*** TODO finish histogram code, write tests
*** TODO decide whether SUB should pass on keys for DATA-FRAME
*** TODO decide whether recursive indexes are practical
    code is still there, but commented out
